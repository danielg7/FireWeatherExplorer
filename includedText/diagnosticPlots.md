Use these plots to determine the data quality of the station of interest.

Questions to ask yourself:

* Are there significant holes in the data?
* Are there periods of time where the region may have been hotter and drier or colder and wetter, and thus may not best represent the period of interest?
* Does any of the data look "bad" - RH unreasonably high, etc?
